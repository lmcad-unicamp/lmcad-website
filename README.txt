This website is a collection of static pages generated by bash scripts.

1) Generating the pages after changing the contents

a) The scripts are located at the src directory.

b) In order to execute the scripts properly you must change into the
   src directories.

c) Once you change into the src directory, execute the gen_pages.sh
   script to generate the pages.

   #> ./gen_pages.sh

2) Changing the contents

a) Every page shares the same header (which is composed by the lab
   logo, the banner and the navigation menu) and the footer (which
   shows the copyright and closes the body). To add a new page at the
   menu just change the common/header.html file.

b) The people page is generated by the gen_people_page.sh script,
   which is called by the gen_pages.sh. In order to add new people to
   the page, you must add a photo (.png) and a description file
   (.info) at one of the following directories:
   src/people/staff
   src/people/collaborators
   src/people/students-phd
   src/people/students-msc
   src/people/students-undergrad

   The photo and description file must be named using the following convention:
     PHOTO: person.name.png
     DESCR: person.name.png.info

   In order to work properly, the script requires the name of the
   description file to be formed by the concatenation of the photo
   filename and the ".info" string.

c) The publications page is also generated automatically. In order to
   add new publications insert a description (.info) file at one of
   the following directories:

   src/publications/2014
   src/publications/2015
   ...

   In order to keep it organized, please copy the entry from the
   Lattes webpage and paste into the description file.

d) other pages are located at the src/pages directory.
